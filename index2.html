                In 2022, Musk bought Twitter after complaining about Internet censorship and criticizing Twitter for suspending the Babylon Bee. The first few weeks of his tenure as CEO has attracted criticism from some, who point to his mass layoffs of employees and his supposed disinterest in moderating hate speech.
                Twitter's board agreed to sell the company to Musk for $44 billion in April 2022, after he disclosed a 9.1% stake and threatened a hostile takeover.
The deal closed in October 2022 after Musk tried to back out and Twitter sued. Musk now owns an estimated 74% of the company.
